# Frontend-Backend Integration

This document outlines the integration between the frontend and backend components of AgentFlow Pro.

## Overview

The frontend is a React application that communicates with the backend FastAPI service through RESTful API endpoints. The integration enables users to create and manage AI agents, crews, and workflows through the UI.

## API Services

We've created the following API service modules in the frontend:

1. **Agent API**: For creating and managing individual AI agents
2. **Crew API**: For creating and managing teams of agents (crews)
3. **Workflow API**: For creating and executing workflows
4. **Chat API**: For direct communication with the AI orchestrator

## Custom React Hooks

To simplify API interactions, we've created custom React hooks:

1. **useAgents()**: Provides methods for agent operations with loading/error states
2. **useCrews()**: Provides methods for crew operations with loading/error states
3. **useWorkflows()**: Provides methods for workflow operations with loading/error states
4. **useChat()**: Provides methods for chat operations with loading/error states

## UI Components

We've updated the following UI components to use the API services:

1. **AgentStudio**: Now fetches real agents from the backend and allows creating new agents
2. **TaskOrchestrator**: Now uses real crews for task execution

## Error Handling

All API interactions include proper error handling:

1. Loading states are tracked and displayed to users
2. Error messages are captured and displayed
3. Retry mechanisms are provided for failed operations

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the UI (e.g., creates an agent)
2. UI component calls the appropriate custom hook method
3. Hook method calls the API service
4. API service makes HTTP request to backend
5. Response is processed and returned to the UI
6. UI updates to reflect the changes

## Future Improvements

1. Add authentication and authorization
2. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
3. Add caching for frequently accessed data
4. Implement pagination for large data sets
5. Add more comprehensive error handling and logging
