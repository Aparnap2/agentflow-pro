# 🧠 AgentFlow – AI Agent PaaS Vision

🌐 Core Concept
A platform to build, monitor, iterate and orchestrate AI agents for automating boring/repetitive business tasks — with human-in-the-loop and workflow scheduling/triggers.

📌 Use Case Types
- SaaS Ops

- Finance (Invoices, Bookkeeping)  
- Emails & Communication  
- Content Repurposing  
- Marketing Automation

Orchestration (Trigger, Flow, HIL)


🤝 Team-Agent Collaboration Model
- Manager Agent → Orchestrates tasks
- Co-founder Agent → Acts as a bridge: translates business intent
- Human Owner Input → Foundation of strategy, research, and planning
- Agents collaborate and update each other (via shared memory or context)

---

✅ Next Steps
- Create modular agent roles (Manager, Researcher, Bridge)
- Define context-sharing via Upstash Redis or LangGraph
- Use tools like Supabase for structured user input (goals/tasks)
- Add scheduling layer (e.g., cron with LangGraph run triggers)
