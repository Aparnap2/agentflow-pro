Absolutely! Here’s a **Backend-Only PRD** for your AgentFlow platform, focusing on API-driven, code-first, modular, and persistent agent orchestration—designed to integrate seamlessly with your Next.js frontend.

---

# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AgentFlow Backend

---

## 1. Purpose

Build a scalable, modular backend API platform to orchestrate, monitor, and persist AI agent workflows for business automation. The backend exposes REST/gRPC endpoints for the Next.js frontend, handles agent orchestration, memory, tool integration, scheduling, and human-in-the-loop (HIL) checkpoints.

---

## 2. Scope

- **Backend only:** No UI or frontend logic.
- **API-driven:** All features accessible via documented endpoints.
- **Integration-ready:** Designed for seamless connection with Next.js frontend.

## 3. Core Features

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent Orchestration**        | Graph-based orchestration (LangGraph) of modular agents; supports complex, parallel workflows |
| **LLM-Powered Agents**         | Agents use OpenRouter LLM for reasoning, text generation, and tool use                        |
| **Persistent Memory**          | Qdrant (vector) for semantic memory/RAG, Neo4j (Graphiti) for structured/relational memory   |
| **Human-in-the-Loop (HIL)**    | API endpoints for pausing workflows, awaiting/retrieving human input, and resuming execution  |
| **Scheduling & Triggers**      | Cron/event-based workflow initiation; endpoints for managing schedules and triggers           |
| **Tool/API Integration**       | Crawl4AI and free APIs for data extraction, email, calendar, social, etc.                     |
| **Context Sharing**            | Agents share context through persistent memory and optional Redis (Upstash) for ephemeral data|
| **Data Validation**            | All agent inputs/outputs validated with Pydantic schemas                                      |
| **Monitoring & Logging**       | Centralized logging of agent actions, workflow status, and errors (API-accessible)           |

- **Open-source/freemium tools only**
- **Stateless API** (except for persistent memory layers)
- **Secure** endpoints (JWT/OAuth2, CORS, rate-limiting)
- **Scalable**: Async processing, queue-based task execution
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new agents, tools, or workflows
